Real-world application: Weather apps are widely used and practical, providing users with valuable information 
about current weather conditions.

API integration: This project demonstrates the ability to integrate with external APIs, specifically the OpenWeatherMap API, 
to fetch weather data. API integration is a common task in web development and demonstrates proficiency in working with external 
data sources.

Frontend development: The project involves frontend development using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. It showcases skills 
in building user interfaces, handling user input, and updating content dynamically.

AJAX: The use of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) for making asynchronous requests to the server demonstrates proficiency 
in handling data asynchronously without needing to reload the entire web page.

DOM manipulation: The JavaScript code in the project manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) to update the content of HTML 
elements dynamically. This skill is essential for creating interactive and responsive web applications.

Error handling: The project includes error handling to deal with situations where the API request fails or returns an error. 
Implementing robust error handling enhances the user experience and demonstrates proficiency in handling unexpected scenarios.

Responsive design: By using Bootstrap, the project ensures that the weather app is responsive and accessible across different devices 
and screen sizes. Responsive design is crucial for providing a consistent user experience across various platforms.

Overall, this weather app project is great because it combines practicality with the demonstration of various web development skills, 
including API integration, frontend development, asynchronous programming, error handling, and responsive design. It serves as an 
excellent portfolio piece to showcase your abilities as a web developer.
